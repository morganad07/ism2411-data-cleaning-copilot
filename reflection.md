What Copilot generates
In this project, I first went to GitHub, made a respository, then put it into Visual Code studio. I then created folders and files in my original folder. Copilot then assisted me with suggesting structures for my code, like in the data_cleaning.py script. For example, it suggested code for things like clean_column_names(). I also used Copilot to ask it describe functions of the codes.

What I modified
When I used Copilot to assist me in suggesting structures for my code, I modified a few things to make sure my code met the standards for the assignment, as well as meeting my understanding. With my CSV I adjusted it so that my code could run it without missing columns and such. In clean_column_names() I replaced hyphens with underscores. This made the code clean and able to analyze.

What I learned
I learned many things through this project, the first being that we cannot rely solely on AI to complete codes. The codes still require human oversight to adjust it so that the outcome is clean and ready to analyze. Despite this fact however, Copilot is an incredibly useful tool. I also learned that messy data should have human oversight. For example, I had to manually analyze product's because the information in the CSV wasn't seperated by commas. This shows how important it is to look over the dataset before applying the code.
